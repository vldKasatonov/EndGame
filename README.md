# 🍽️ Game Overview  

> **"Funny Chef"** is a fast-paced **restaurant simulator** where every second counts!  

### 🎯 Your Goal:  
✔️ Serve all visitors by preparing the correct dishes.  
✔️ Beat the clock – **the faster, the higher the score!**  
✔️ Progress through levels, unlocking **new recipes** and increasing the challenge.  

💡 This game tests your **reaction, multitasking and decision-making skills** in a fun and engaging way!  

# 🎮 Game Features

**Ready to cook?** Then jump in and get started with **Funny Chef** where every dish is a new adventure! 🍴👨‍🍳

### 📜 **Menu**

Navigating through the game is as easy as flipping a pancake! 🥞 The main menu is designed for smooth gameplay with everything you need at your fingertips:

- **Play** 🟢 *(Start your culinary adventure here!)*
- **Developers Info** 📜
- **Exit** 🚪 *(Time to wrap it up?)*
- **Settings** ⚙️ *(Customize your gameplay)*

Two modes are available:
- **Single-player** 🧑‍🍳
- **Two-player** *(Currently in development — stay tuned! 👀)*

Once you choose your mode, you’ll enter the **Level Menu**. Initially, only the first level is unlocked, but as you progress, more levels open up, allowing you to unlock new recipes and challenges!

To add a little extra challenge, your performance is rewarded with stars based on how quickly you complete each level:

- **Stars** 🌟 — Each level is timed and the number of stars you earn depends on how fast you complete it.
- The **best score** for each level is saved in the **Level Menu**, allowing you to track your progress and compete against yourself!

You can access the **Settings** from anywhere during the game. It includes:

- **Volume Control** 🔊 *(Adjust music and sound effects to your liking)*
- **Delete Progress** 🔄 *(Reset your records and start fresh)*
- **Guide** 📖 *(Learn about controls and cooking techniques)*

Once you exit the settings, you'll return to where you left off in the game.

🛑 When you want to exit the game, quit by pausing a level or delete progress, a pop-up confirmation window will appear, ensuring that you don’t make accidental mistakes.

### 🍳 **Gameplay:**

The gameplay evolves as you progress through the levels, each unlocking a new recipe! With each new dish, the challenges become more complex, keeping things fresh and exciting. 🌶️

If you're not sure how to prepare a dish, no worries! Just check the **Guide** for instructions on the cooking process. 📚

- **7-Slot Inventory** 🛠️ — Keep your ingredients stored and ready for action. You can use this to multitask and manage cooking multiple dishes simultaneously!
- **Unique Recipes** 🍔 — Each recipe requires specific tools and methods of preparation. Just like a real kitchen, different devices and techniques are required for different dishes.
- **Need a break?** ⏸️ You can pause or exit at any time, but keep in mind: **Your progress won’t be saved if you quit from a level**. So make sure you finish your level before calling it a day!

💡 **Tip:** Always follow the right cooking method! If you mix things up — for example, blending fries or frying an apple 🍏 — nothing will happen! Failure to follow the recipe will result in zero progress. 

Customers are picky! 😤 If you serve the wrong dish, they’ll refuse it and continue waiting for their correct order. Keep your eyes on the prize and stay focused!
